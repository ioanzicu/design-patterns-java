## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA DEPENDENCIES` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-pack/blob/master/release-notes/v0.9.0.md#work-with-jar-files-directly).




# **The Abstract Factory Patter**

- defines an interface for creating **an object**, but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate
- it lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses

The intent of Factory Method
is to allow a class to defer
instantiation to its subclasses.

# **The Abstract Factory Pattern**

- provides an interface for creating **families of related objects** without specifying its concrete implementation.

The intent of Factory Method
is to allow a class to defer
instantiation to its subclasses.


# **The Dependency Inversion**

- guides us to **avoid dependencies on concrete types**
and to **strive for abstractions**.
